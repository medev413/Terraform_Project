Successfully created the VPC and EC2 instances in VPC.

Created Load Balancer & attached them to the required target group.

But, still unable to access the python web server using the load balancer dns resolver.

Have to work the port & protocol while creating the LB, lb_target_group & lb_listener & lb_tg_attachment.

Believe that is causing the issue.
